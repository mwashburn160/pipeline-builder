# platform

The identity, authentication, and organization service at the center of the platform — the source of truth for users, organizations, RBAC, and JWT issuance that every other service authenticates against.

## Responsibilities

- **Authentication & JWT issuance** — registration, login, refresh, logout, org switching, email verification, and step-up re-authentication; issues the access/refresh token pair every other service verifies.
- **User management** — self-service profile, password changes, API-token issuance/revocation, plus system-admin user administration.
- **Organizations** — multi-tenant containers for pipelines, plugins, and quotas; org-to-team hierarchy (descendants/subtree), tier and quota management, GDPR export, and cascading deletion.
- **RBAC / roles & write-access enforcement** — the coarse per-org label (`owner` | `admin` | `member`) is *derived* from a user's Roles and resolved from the `UserOrganization` junction (it governs ownership, seat accounting, and `isAdmin`, not permissions), plus platform `superadmin`, and a read-only impersonation gate that blocks state-changing requests.
- **Roles & memberships** — first-class Roles (e.g. Admin, Member, the system org's Super Admin) that carry explicit `resource:action` permissions; a user's effective permissions are the union of their assigned Roles, and Role membership still drives the derived, cached `UserOrganization.role` label. (The API calls a Role a permission *group*.)
- **Audit events** — tamper-resistant, org-scoped audit log (TTL-retained in MongoDB) with an internal service-token ingest endpoint for non-platform emitters.
- **Email delivery** — owns the SMTP/SES transport (invitations, verification) and exposes an internal service-token endpoint (`POST /internal/notify-email`) so other services (e.g. compliance) can email an org's users without their own mail stack; resolves recipients (`targetUsers`, or all org admins) from the user directory.

## Configuration

All config is read from environment variables (see `src/config/index.ts`). `JWT_SECRET` and `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` are required in production (a dev-only insecure fallback is used otherwise); `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is required in production for at-rest encryption of provider keys.
